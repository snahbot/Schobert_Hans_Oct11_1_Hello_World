            <h1>Okay so like, Super Mario Wonder is a good game</h1>
            <p>I've just been playing Super Mario Wonder on my switch since it came out. Honestly the only way I can describe it is just: Pleasant. It's really Pleasant, from the music, to the levels, the game is just a lovely time. But I find myself in the frustating position because I really want to talk to people about it. But I can't, because I'd spoiler the surprise and wonder of playing the game. Each level is a treat to explore because of the Wonder Flowers, and they make all the levels exicting to play just because you don't know what to expect.</p>

            <p>So like I'm sittin' there in my discord call. Wanting to tell my friends why they should play Super Mario Wonder. But if I explain to them why it'll ruin some of the magic. So instead I have to think to myself how to discreetly nudge them in that direction without revealing the hand, So to speak. It's just been a big challenge, however that obviously hasn't stopped me from enjoying the game. I didn't mean to imply that, sorry. No no, I'm sor- I'm sorry. No listen I'M SORRY, you don't have to appologize I'm sorry here. Sorry, I got off topic what was I talking about? Oh yeah, Super Mario Wonder, uhhhhhh.... Talking Flowers, Multipler Features. Click below for more. Or leave.</p>
