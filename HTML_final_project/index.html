                <p>TF2's first major update in 2012 was an interesting one, when on the final day of the reveal campaign a new feature was showed off to players. <b>Pyrovision,</b> as it's called, is a special filter that is applyed when wearing a handful of cosmetic items on your character. On participating maps, it replaces almost all textures with soft pastel variants which create a charming and whimsical atsmosphere. It also pitches up the voices of all other players, as well as replacing their agonizing screams with simple laughter. Finally, small details such as replacing player gibs with silly probs and adding small lights to ropes, strings, and wire complete to look of Pyroland. So strap on your Pyrovision Goggles and get really to explore the "wonder-scarred, burn-filled" landscape of Pyroland.</p>
