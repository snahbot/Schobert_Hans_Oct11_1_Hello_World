    <p>Welcome to my web page! We have pizza, and uh... pizza, maybe we have a few arcade cabnets or something around here, give me a chance to look around and I'm sure I'll find our  X-Man tower at least; I know it's around here somewhere. Well hey, if that's not your taste, I've also got some light reading in one of the void folds around here. Hey where are you going? There's no where out there...</p>

    <h1>Tourism Tips of the Pizza Void</h1>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Bring your camera! There's lots of things to see in the pizza void</li>
        <li>Be sure to apply lots of suncreen! Our wonderful one (1) pizza is our sole source of light in the void and it amits a staggering: <i>[15]</i> UVs!</li>
        <li>Watch out for the creature! there may be no walls or obstructions of any kind but that doesn't stop the Pizza monster from regularly giving tourists a good startle, before it disembowls them!</li>
        <li>If there are any questions, feel to ask our curator; omneisant being and sole propritor of the Pizza Void.</li>

    </ul>

    <p>Not so fun to wander around without me when the Pizza Monster tries to slash you to pieces with it's claws, you're lucky I pulled it away before it was too late, eh? Don't disrespect me again or there will be <b>grave consequences.</b> You even miss the <b>PIZZA BARBEQUE!!!</b> <i>OoOOOOOooOoOOoOhh!!!</i> </p>
